VoKS-ios
========

This project constitutes the iOS app as part of the BComeSafe alarm system. Its purpose is to let users trigger the alarm, stream audio and video to the Shelter, and communicate textually with the shelter.

The project is set up as an XCode project, which must be installed in at least version 7. Several third-party library files have been omitted from the GIT repository, and must be added before compilation.
